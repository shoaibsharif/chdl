A CLI downloader for Coursehunter.com

I was kinda exhausted keep downloading coursehunter tutorials one by one. Then I came up with the idea to use CLI where I will give them course url name and it will download the course for me. Also, it was fun to automate this using CLI.

Make sure you have nodejs >= 10 installed and all you have to run

```bash
npm run dev
```

It will ask you some questions and all you have to answer those questions.
